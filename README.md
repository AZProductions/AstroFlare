# 1. **Intuitive Syntax.**
<img align="right" width="400" height="300" src="https://via.placeholder.com/400/">

AstroFlare combines the best features from the popular languages like C#, JavaScript and Rust into one package. The syntax uses a *Smart Bracketing System* and more. Compile programs even faster using it's state of the art Packaging System. [Learn more about **AstroFlare.**]()

</br>

# 2. **Fast Compile times.**
AstroFlare uses a direct compiling engine which improves compile speeds by a lot. We're still building on it, so check back in a while to see higher performance increases. As we change our shift in the way programming works, AstroFlare will follow along.  [Get started with **AstroFlare Direct Compiling**.]()

# 3. **In-house Rendering Engine.**
<img align="left" width="500" height="200" src="https://via.placeholder.com/400/">

AstroFlare uses native and *In-House* rendering solutions, to display your software with the highest quality possible. As we provide a wider range of product support, we're also planning on releasing different **UI (UserInterface) Kits**, which are following the standards layed out by UI/UX designers. [Learn more about **AstroFlare Rendering and UI Kits.**]()

<br/>


# 4. **LightSpeed™ Jit compiled compiler.**
AstroFlare by itself is compiled in Jit, which decreases the time it spends loading in memory. This is a major game-changer. We're also introducing another inbuilt project called **LightSpeed™**. LightSpeed is a new compiling engine used in AstroFlare and the AstroFlare Compiler. [Learn more how to **incorporate LightSpeed™ into your own products**.]()
